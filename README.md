# skema: language that compiles to jsonschema, graphql, typescript interfaces, c++ structs, python classes and many more

## What you can do with a skema file:
- Validate json input
- Generare code types in graphql, py, ts, cpp, ...
- Generate fake data for testing
- Generate react forms, via `react-skema-forms`
- Infer schema from raw json files
- convert jsonschema to be easier to read
And beign somewhat creative:
- use it as documentation
- use it to plan your domain model!

## example


this skema snippet
```yaml
AddedTodo:
    type: "added_todo" | "ciao"
    payload:
        todo:
            name: Str

RemovedTodo:
    type: "removed_todo"
    payload:
        id: Str
    todo_id: Int

Event: AddedTodo | RemovedTodo
```
generates json schema
```json
{
    "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
    "definitions": {
        "AddedTodo": {

## spec

- all root properties are references and can be used as types
- types can be object whose properties are expressed as key: value or other primitive types like 
    - Str,
    - Int,
    - Bool,
    - Float
    - /regex/
    - 0..100 (int range)
    - .0..1 (float range)
- type inside [ ] is an array type
- types can be mixed together: 
    - `Str | Int` means one of string and int
    - `Object1 & Object2` means "all the properties of object 1 and 2"
    - `Object1 | Object2` means "properties of object 1 and 2"
- types can be annotated writing annotations inside " or """ quotes
```yaml
"The event type"
Event:
    type: "trigger" | "unknown"
    data:
        ...
    by: User

"""
The annotation will be put in json schema description,
can also be used to write the type to use in fake_data:
:type datetime.datetime
The faker will try tu use this Class
"""
User:
    name: Str
    phone: Int
```

## todo:
- | and & don't work with [], because VAl is split with ARRAY and smaller VAL during tokenization, is hould add a rule during tokenization to exclude | and & in array tokens and add array logic inside VAL handling
- the same for regex
- better handling of comments and white space
- dynamic indentation (now is set as 4 spaces)
- ~~in gql remove types used in & operations, given that thay are merged~~
- replace removed types names from other computed names




bugs:
- if key name is equal to another type name then fuck it up
- can't write `key: [Str] | Int`
- objects get additionalProps: true by default even if they haven't ... at the end like:
```
Object:
    a: Str
    b: Int
    ...
```
this is because i always forget to put them when doing `Object1 & Object2` so i just removed it



graphql todos:
- remove useless parent nesting in names if possible
- assert no other types exist before generating one
- customization for Interface_end_name,
