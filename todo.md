## todo:
from_jsonschema:
- add requierd types
- add additionalProperties as ellipses 


- multiple interfaces not supported in grammar
- better grammar with asssocativity and precedence explicited
- ~~when generating python i have to order dependencies over the types~~
- ~~scalar unions with null should be removed from graphql~~
- ~~specify if a type gets translated as input, interface in graphql, [graphql input]~~
- graphql doesn't support union inside unions, so i must unnest them
- when creating python code, special keywords (from) are padded with parent names, this means i can't use `ObjectName(**data)`
- better handling of comments and white space
